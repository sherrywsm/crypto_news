The proposal presents data on exchange rate pricing and market pricing and aims to clarify the desired pricing mechanism as Compound expands its support for staking assets. Gauntlet provided insights on LST liquidity, which currently shows no negative price trends but may be at risk of shrinking as liquidity shifts to other protocols. To mitigate liquidity risks, Compound could consider using exchange rate-based oracles for LSTs. Market pricing, which relies on trading activity, has been the status quo using Chainlink price feeds. Exchange rate pricing, on the other hand, represents the redemption exchange rate between a staking asset and its base. The proposal also discusses risk mitigation strategies and a proposed oracle implementation.

There are two types of Sybil attacks: direct, where malicious nodes interact with honest nodes to control decision-making processes, and indirect, where malicious nodes leverage other malicious nodes to alter the network's topology. Sybil attacks are most effective in networks with pseudoanonymous participation, such as social media and blockchain networks. Blockchain networks are particularly targeted due to their high value. Examples of Sybil attacks on blockchain networks include Ethereum Classic and Verge. To defend against Sybil attacks, blockchain networks utilize cryptoeconomic security, reputation systems, and identity verification.

COCM is a tweak to the Pairwise Match algorithm that attenuates a project's funding if many donors have similar donation patterns. The article presents experiments showing that COCM is more resilient to sybil attacks compared to standard quadratic funding (QF). Passport's Model-Based Detection system analyzes on-chain history to assign a score to addresses, indicating the likelihood of being a sybil or a genuine user. The system requires minimal user interaction and reduces user frustration.

To better assess lending market efficiency, Gauntlet will introduce two metrics: the Non-borrowing Depositor Ratio, which measures the proportion of depositors who have not borrowed against their deposits, and the Non-borrowing Depositors' Fund Ratio, which calculates the share of collateral provided by non-borrowing depositors in relation to the total collateral pool. Gauntlet found that approximately 30% of depositors do not engage in borrowing, with the highest ratio on Base WETH and the lowest on Arbitrum USDC comet. While the majority of non-borrowing depositors are small retail users, deposits can reach up to $8 million.

The feature offers two key benefits: decoupling of L2 block frequency from L1 costs and reduced fixed L1 operating costs. Currently, L1 operating costs are linear in the number of blocks, regardless of their mass. This creates a trade-off between cost efficiency and low block times. However, with applicative recursion, a new recursive tree called a SNAR tree is introduced. Each tree has configurable limits and is closed when one of its limits is reached. The L1 operating cost structure is modified, and the fixed-per-job gas cost is now amortized over all the blocks in a single SNAR tree. This decouples blocks from L1 costs and improves cost efficiency. The article concludes by posing questions about the optimal number of blobs per tree and the desired block times.",https://community.starknet.io/t/feature-starknet-applicative-recursion/113868
