The proposal presents data on exchange rate pricing and market pricing and aims to clarify the desired pricing mechanism as Compound expands its support for staking assets. Gauntlet provided insights on LST liquidity, which currently shows no negative price trends but may be at risk of shrinking as liquidity shifts to other protocols. To mitigate liquidity risks, Compound could consider using exchange rate-based oracles for LSTs. Market pricing, which relies on trading activity, has been the status quo using Chainlink price feeds. Exchange rate pricing, on the other hand, represents the redemption exchange rate between a staking asset and its base. The proposal also discusses risk mitigation strategies and a proposed oracle implementation.

This attack is commonly used in peer-to-peer networks, including blockchain networks, to manipulate and exploit the system. There are two types of Sybil attacks: direct, where malicious nodes interact with honest nodes to control decision-making processes, and indirect, where malicious nodes leverage other malicious nodes to alter the network's topology. Sybil attacks are most effective in networks with pseudoanonymous participation, such as social media and blockchain networks. Blockchain networks are particularly targeted due to their high value. Examples of Sybil attacks on blockchain networks include Ethereum Classic and Verge. To defend against Sybil attacks, blockchain networks utilize cryptoeconomic security, reputation systems, and identity verification. While Sybil attacks remain a threat, blockchain networks are designed to be resilient against them while maintaining an open and permissionless structure.",https://blog.chain.link/sybil-attack/

COCM is a tweak to the Pairwise Match algorithm that attenuates a project's funding if many donors have similar donation patterns. The article presents experiments showing that COCM is more resilient to sybil attacks compared to standard quadratic funding (QF). Passport's Model-Based Detection system analyzes on-chain history to assign a score to addresses, indicating the likelihood of being a sybil or a genuine user. The system requires minimal user interaction and reduces user frustration. The article also discusses the impact of COCM and Model-Based Detection on funding outcomes, showing a positive correlation between the two strategies.
